/*
 * ðŸ“• 01 - PROPERTY CARD
 *
 *
 * ðŸ‘‰ STEP 1
 *
 * Add a thumbnail image for the property with a height of 300px and a width of 100%.
 * - To this image, add a borderRadius using a style prop with a 'medium' radius.
 * - Be sure to add alt text! (Hint: Look at the props available on PropertyCard).
 *
 * - Make your browser smaller and see how the image responds. What prop and
 * value on the Image could we use to make the image still fit 100% but no longer
 * look stretched?
 * (Hint: Check out the Image component docs demo for objectFit
 * https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/components/image#demo )
 *
 * ðŸ‘‰ STEP 2
 *
 * Add a Rating with size 'small' and a gap of 'xxxs'.
 *
 * ðŸ‘‰ STEP 3
 *
 * Add an Icon for bed. (Hint: The bed icon is already imported.)
 * - Convert the div currently wrapping the bed icon and accompanying
 * text to a Flex component.
 * - Add a 'xxxs' gap to this new Flex component.
 * - Add a flex layout rule to this Flex component to center the Icon with the text.
 * (Hint: how can we use alignItems?)
 * - On the Flex component, add a color style prop using the '80' color in the neutral range.
 * - How can we hide the icon to screen readers since it is decorative?
 * (Hint: what ARIA property can we pass to the Icon component to make it hidden?)
 *
 * ðŸ‘‰ STEP 4
 *
 * Add an H2 heading with the properties name.
 * - Use the truncated prop to keep the name to one line.
 * Note: we'll adjust the font-size in the next lab!
 *
 * ðŸ‘‰ STEP 5
 *
 * Add a Text component to show the properties rate with a dollar sign.
 * - Make this new Text component and the one immediately following line up
 * on the same line.
 * (Hint: what value can we pass to the 'as' prop on each?
 * See Text demo: https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/components/text)
 *
 *
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ HINT
 *
 * The completed code is in the same directory!
 *
 * âœ¨ BONUS 1
 *
 *  Add a few badges to the card, for example "Good for pets" or "No deposit"

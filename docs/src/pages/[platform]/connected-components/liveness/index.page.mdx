title: Liveness
description: Amplify UI Face Liveness provides a UI component that helps developers deter fraud and scams during face-based identity checks by validating that users are physically present in front of the camera at that moment, and not an imposter spoofing the user's face.
supportedFrameworks: react|android|swift
---

import { Fragment } from '@/components/Fragment';
import { getCustomStaticPath } from '@/utils/getCustomStaticPath';

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return getCustomStaticPath(frontmatter.supportedFrameworks);
}

{/*  `getStaticProps` is required to prevent "Error: getStaticPaths was added without a getStaticProps. Without getStaticProps, getStaticPaths does nothing" */}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  return { props: {} }
}

Amplify UI Face Liveness is powered by [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/).

## Quick start

<Fragment>
  {({ platform }) => import(`./prerequisite.${platform}.mdx`)}
</Fragment>

### Step 1. Configure Amplify

<Fragment>
  {({ platform }) => import(`./quick-start-pull.${platform}.mdx`)}
</Fragment>

Now that you have Amplify Auth setup, follow the steps below to create an inline policy to enable authenticated app users to access Rekognition.

1. Go to AWS IAM console â†’ Roles

2. Select the newly created `unauthRole` for your project (`amplify-<project_name>-<env_name>-<id>-unauthRole`). Note that `unauthRole` should be used if you are not logging in, but if you are using an authenticator with your application, you will need to use `authRole`.

3. Choose **Add Permissions**, then select **Create Inline Policy**, then choose **JSON** and paste the following:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "rekognition:StartFaceLivenessSession",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

4. Choose **Review Policy**

5. Name the policy

6. Choose **Create Policy**

To use Amplify UI Liveness, you must also set up a backend to create the liveness session and retrieve the liveness session results. Follow the [Amazon Rekognition Liveness guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/face-liveness-programming-api.html) to set up your backend.

<Fragment>{({ platform }) => import(`./quick-start-add.${platform}.mdx`)}</Fragment>

## Best Practices

* End users should complete the Face Liveness check in environments that aren't too dark or too bright and have fairly uniform lighting.
* You should choose a value for the confidence score threshold that reflects the nature of your use case. For use cases with greater security concerns, use a higher threshold.
* You should regularly run human review checks on audit images to check that spoof attacks are mitigated at the confidence threshold you set. 
* You should offer an alternative Face Liveness verification path to your end users if they are photo-sensitive or do not wish to verify their Face Liveness using Rekognition.

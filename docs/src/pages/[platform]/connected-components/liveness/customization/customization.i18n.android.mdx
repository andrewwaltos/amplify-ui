The text in the FaceLivenessDetector component is defined as string resources in the component's [strings.xml file](TODO-ADD-LINK). These strings can be translated to other languages by adding the same string resources, but with the translated text, to a strings.xml file in your app's string resource directory for that locale. When the app is run, the string resource file will be automatically chosen based on the device's locale.
